Here is my report of my Capstoone 
My rating from lighthouse wasnt that bad knowing i had work to do, so I felt preety good about the scores.
/Volumes/NO NAME/dev dub/screenshots/Screen Shot 2024-01-13 at 7.28.35 PM.png
Performance score was a 89
Accessibility  was a 88
Best Pratice was a 95
SEO was a 90
PWA was 0
My thoughts on these score is there is a large room for inmporvement, total blocking time was very large being 230ms and it was in red which cant be good.
