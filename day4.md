Performance score was a 89
Accessibility  was a 88
Best Pratice was a 95
SEO was a 90
PWA was 0
My thoughts on these score is there is a large room for inmporvement, total blocking time was very large being 230ms and it was in red which cant be good. 
Diagnostics only had to bullets that was lit up so maybe that good im still learning but that seem good to me.

Performance score was a 89

since im still still learning to read the statics, I will stae the the scripting was long being 580ms I do ont know if thats good but dont seem like it is to me so, lets say we need to fix that issue.

Network I cant really speak much about this just to say the number was very low as far as loading time and thing like

One thing about my capstone is I felt like it was very basic and I cant wait to become a better coder so I can add some real style with confidnece.
I am looking forward to learning how to use these tools to improve my web devolepment .
